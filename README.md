## Â¡Conjugado! (server)

This is an Express server that's paired with an [React front-end](https://github.com/stevopritchard/conjugation_frontend).

### Creating the database

#### Verb Database
This app uses a copy of [Fred Jehle's Spanish Verb Database](https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs)

You'll need to create a new database from the csv-formatted version.
